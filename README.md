Chronic Disease Prediction Model

This project involves building a machine learning model to predict 
the likelihood of chronic diseases using synthetic demographic and health data. 
The model uses key health indicators such as age, BMI, smoking habits, physical activity, hypertension, and cholesterol 
levels to classify individuals as at risk for chronic diseases.
